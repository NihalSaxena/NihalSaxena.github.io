						Hi! My name is Manan and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer-Science + Economics and a Minor in Math at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I have experience in a variety of CS sub-disciplines such as Full-Stack Development, I love exploring new industries and learning how to apply my skills to them. However, I am currently interested in gaining some more experience in fintech.
						<br />
						<br />
						I've worked with people from various backgrounds and am always eager to meet someone new. Feel free to reach out to me to talk about anything!
						<br />
						<br />
						In my free time I love cooking, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. I am always down to grab a bite or go for a walk!
